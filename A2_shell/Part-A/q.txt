/* OS Lab A2
 * Write a shell. 
 * The shell should have following features:
 *
 * A. Read commands in a loop and run commands without complete path names 
 * and handle arguments+options for commands                                        (2 marks)
 *
 * B. Show prompt with current working directory in the prompt and allow user 
 * to change the prompt to a particular string and revert back to CWD prompt        (2 marks)
 * This should be done with following two commands, with specified syntax:
 * PS1="whatever string you want "
 * PS1="\w$"
 *
 * [ This also mandates that the "cd" command should work. 
 * Note that "cd" is always an internal command of shell, and not an executable.
 * It affects the cwd of the shell itself ]
 *
 * C. Handle all possible user input errors                         (1 marks)
 *
 * D. exit gracefully on typing "exit" or ctrl-D  (1 marks)
 *
 * E. allow users to set a variable called PATH which is used for searching 
 * the list of executables (just like in the case of 'bash' shell)   (2 marks)
 * This should be done with a command that has following syntax
 * PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/sbin
 * This combined with first point means that you will NOT be using execvp(), 
 * but rather implement a version of execvp() on your own.
 *
 * F. use the keys : up and down array key and 
 * run a particular command from history (2 marks for this)
 * no need to handle the editing of the current command, just executing a
 * command from history as it is will do.
 * The history need not be persistent.
